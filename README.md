# 📢 UPI Alert System (SoundBox)

An Android-based application that simulates a UPI SoundBox – a device used by merchants to receive audible alerts for successful payments. The app uses text-to-speech (TTS) to read out transaction messages in real time.

## 📦 Download APK

You can download and try the app here:

[📲 Download UPI Alert System APK](release/UPI Alert System.apk)

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 Real-time transaction voice alerts using Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- 📱 Simple and clean user interface
- 🔒 Local transaction history storage
- 🛠️ Built using Java and Android Studio

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Java  
- **Framework:** Android SDK  
- **IDE:** Android Studio  
- **Other:** Google Text-to-Speech API

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User receives a UPI payment.
2. The transaction message is passed to the app.
3. Google TTS reads the message aloud in the preferred language.
4. The message is logged for reference.

> ⚠️ This app is a **simulation** and not connected to real UPI payment APIs.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built to simulate a **merchant-side alert system** that mimics real UPI SoundBox functionality, helping users understand how real-time voice notification systems work in Android.

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time UPI transaction APIs (if publicly available)
- Add multi-language support
- Enhance UI/UX with better design
- Store transactions using SQLite or Room DB
